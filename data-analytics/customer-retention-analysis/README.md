## Project Overview
This project analyses customer retention using transactional retail data. The objective was to understand repeat purchasing behaviour, identify churn patterns, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer lifetime value.

The analysis combines **Python**, **SQL (SQLite)**, and **Power BI** to demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills, from raw data processing to business insight delivery.


## Key Questions
- How many customers return after their first purchase?
- How does retention change over time across different customer cohorts?
- What proportion of customers become repeat buyers?
- Where do the largest drop-offs in the customer lifecycle occur?


## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub


## Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared transactional data using Python.
2. Built a customer-level dataset to analyse repeat purchasing behaviour.
3. Performed cohort-based retention analysis to track customer activity over time.
4. Reproduced key retention logic using SQL for production-style querying.
5. Visualised retention trends using Power BI and summarised findings for stakeholders.


## Key Insights
- Customer churn is highest after the first purchase.
- Customers who make repeat purchases early are significantly more likely to remain active long term.
- Retention patterns are consistent across cohorts, indicating stable but improvable engagement strategies.


## Business Recommendations
- Focus retention efforts on encouraging second purchases.
- Identify and prioritise high-value returning customers.
- Track cohort retention metrics as a core performance indicator.


## Outputs
- Python notebooks for data preparation and retention analysis
- SQL queries for customer lifetime, repeat rate, and cohort retention
- Power BI dashboard visualising retention trends
