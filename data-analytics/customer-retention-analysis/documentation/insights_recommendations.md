## Executive Summary
This analysis uses cohort-based retention techniques to evaluate customer repeat purchasing behaviour over time. Customers were grouped by their first purchase month and tracked across subsequent months to understand churn patterns and long-term retention.

The results highlight **high early churn**, with a sharp drop in retention after the first purchase, followed by **stabilisation among a smaller group of loyal customers**. These insights provide a strong basis for targeted retention strategies aimed at improving customer lifetime value.


## Key Insights

### 1. Significant churn after the first purchase
Across almost all cohorts, retention declines sharply between **Month 1 and Month 2**, with only a small proportion of customers returning after their initial purchase.

**Interpretation:**  
The first purchase alone is not sufficient to build long-term engagement. Many customers disengage early, indicating a gap in post-purchase engagement or follow-up strategy.


### 2. Retention stabilises among returning customers
After the initial drop-off period, retention rates tend to stabilise. Customers who make repeat purchases beyond the first few months are more likely to remain active over time.

**Interpretation:**  
There is a clear distinction between one-time buyers and a loyal customer segment. Encouraging customers to make a second or third purchase is critical to long-term retention.


### 3. Consistent retention patterns across cohorts
Retention trends are broadly similar across different acquisition cohorts, with no clear improvement in newer cohorts compared to earlier ones.

**Interpretation:**  
Customer retention performance has remained relatively consistent over time, suggesting that existing acquisition and engagement strategies have not significantly changed or improved retention outcomes.


### 4. Low long-term retention
By later months in the customer lifecycle, retention levels remain relatively low across cohorts, indicating that only a small subset of customers become long-term repeat buyers.

**Interpretation:**  
Without targeted retention initiatives, most customers churn before reaching high lifetime value.


## Recommendations

### 1. Prioritise second-purchase conversion
Improving the transition from first-time to repeat customer should be the primary focus of retention efforts.

**Suggested actions:**
- Implement post-purchase email or messaging campaigns within the first 30 days  
- Offer time-limited incentives such as discounts or free delivery on a second order  
- Provide personalised product recommendations based on the initial purchase  


### 2. Identify and nurture high-value returning customers
Customers who return beyond the first few months demonstrate higher long-term value and engagement.

**Suggested actions:**
- Segment returning customers and target them with loyalty or rewards programmes  
- Use personalised promotions to encourage repeat purchases  
- Track repeat purchase frequency and customer lifetime value as core KPIs  


### 3. Monitor cohort retention as a core performance metric
Cohort-based retention provides more meaningful insight than overall averages and should be tracked regularly.

**Suggested actions:**
- Include cohort retention analysis in ongoing performance reporting  
- Compare retention before and after marketing or engagement initiatives  
- Use retention trends to evaluate the effectiveness of customer experience improvements  


### 4. Align retention strategy with revenue growth
Retention improvements are likely to have a direct impact on revenue and profitability.

**Suggested actions:**
- Link retention metrics with revenue and AOV analysis  
- Focus investment on initiatives that improve customer lifetime value rather than acquisition volume alone
