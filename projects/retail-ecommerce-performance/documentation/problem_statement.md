# Retail / E-commerce Performance – Problem Statement

This project analyses historical retail transaction data to understand overall business performance. The objective is to provide an interactive view of revenue, order behaviour, customer activity, and geographic performance to support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source

This analysis reuses the cleaned retail transaction dataset produced in the *Retail / E-commerce Performance* project. The dataset was previously cleaned and validated, and is reused here to focus specifically on customer behaviour and retention patterns rather than overall sales performance.


## Key business questions include:
- How is revenue trending over time?
- Which countries and products contribute most to revenue?
- What is the average order value and customer behaviour across markets?
- How can insights from the data inform inventory planning and sales strategy?
